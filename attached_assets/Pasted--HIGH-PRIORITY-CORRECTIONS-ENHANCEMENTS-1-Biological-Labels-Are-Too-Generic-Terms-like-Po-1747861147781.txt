🔬 HIGH-PRIORITY CORRECTIONS & ENHANCEMENTS
1. Biological Labels Are Too Generic

    Terms like “Population A” or “Population B” are not meaningful for clinical or research use.

✅ Replace with specific cell types, e.g.:

- Sensitive Tumor Cells (ALK+)
- Resistant Tumor Clones
- CD8+ T Cells
- NK Cells
- Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (optional)

2. Simulation Output Lacks Clinical Units

    The Y-axis is in arbitrary units.

✅ Recommendation:

    Show population in relative % or estimated cell count (e.g. 1e6 cells)

    Allow user to toggle between log scale and linear

3. Lack of Time Control & Realistic Dosing

    Time axis is unlabeled (days? weeks?).

    No dose control or drug half-life behavior.

✅ Add:

- Time unit toggle (days/weeks/months)
- Drug administration schedule (continuous, pulsed, adaptive)
- Half-life input (tied to drug decay curve)

4. Immune System Is Oversimplified

    Appears as one undifferentiated immune response.

    Doesn't reflect immune suppression by tumor or feedback inhibition.

✅ Suggested Model Expansion:

    Add variable for tumor-mediated suppression (IL-10/TGF-β analog)

    Add parameter: immune exhaustion over time

    Plot immune activation vs suppression balance

5. No Resistance Evolution Yet

    Resistance is static — tumor populations are pre-defined as resistant or not.

✅ Add Evolutionary Game Theory Layer:

# Simple version:
if treatment_pressure > threshold:
    mutation_rate += f(environmental_pressure)
    resistant_cells += mutated_cells

# Output:
“% resistant cells increasing under drug exposure”

6. Graphs Need Event Markers

    Treatment start, stop, or transitions aren't labeled on the graph.

✅ Add event markers to plot, e.g.:

- Vertical line on Day 20: “Drug ON”
- Shaded area: “Immunotherapy phase”

7. No Clinical Scenario Templates

Currently, the user has to enter abstract numbers.

✅ Add drop-down presets, such as:

- Scenario 1: ALK+ NSCLC on Brigatinib
- Scenario 2: EGFR-mutant NSCLC on Osimertinib
- Scenario 3: High PD-L1 NSCLC on Pembrolizumab

Each with pre-filled growth/resistance/immune parameters.
8. Missing Real-World Biomarker Integration

✅ Add:

- ctDNA output curve (reflecting tumor burden)
- IL-6 / CRP curve (reflecting inflammation)
- PD-L1 score estimate (adjusts immune effect)

9. User Interface Suggestions

    Add tooltips on each parameter: e.g. “Drug Efficacy: reduction in tumor growth per time unit”

    Allow real-time adjustment: sliders that auto-update simulation

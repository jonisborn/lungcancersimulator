# Lung Cancer Simulator

A clinically-inspired cancer simulation tool using game theory and real-world oncology data.
Simulates tumor evolution, treatment response, and survival outcomes for virtual patients.

## Features

- Models tumor cell populations and drug response
- Estimates PFS (Progression-Free Survival) and OS (Overall Survival)
- Visualizes tumor burden, drug levels, and clinical response
- Customizable patient and treatment parameters

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jonisborn/lungcancersimulator.git
   cd lungcancersimulator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the simulator:**
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
   Then open your browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Example

Try simulating a Stage IV NSCLC patient on immunotherapy and see the predicted OS and PFS!
